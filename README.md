# Stiffness_Method_MatLab
Matrix Stiffness method for Structural Analysis of 2D frames. 

A simple code to do structural analysis of 2D frame structures using the Direct Stiffness Method.
The input data must be done by a Excel Spreadsheet.
The routine calculates the displacement and internal forces of each element. Also plots the Moment and Shear Diagrams.
